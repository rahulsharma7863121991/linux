Assignment-1: Web Server Setup for WordPress

Please create a command-line script, preferably in bash, to perform following tasks in order.

    Your script will check if PHP, Mysql & Nginx are installed. If not present, missing packages will be installed.
    The script will then ask user for domain name. (Suppose user enters example.com)
    Create a /etc/hosts entry for example.com pointing to localhost IP.
    Create nginx config file for example.com
    Download WordPress latest version from http://wordpress.org/latest.zip and unzip it locally in example.com document root.
    Create a new mysql database for new WordPress. (database name “example.com_db” )
    Create wp-config.php with proper DB configuration. (You can use wp-config-sample.php as your template)
    You may need to fix file permissions, cleanup temporary files, restart or reload nginx config.
    Tell user to open example.com in browser (if all goes well)
